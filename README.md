Sure, let's break down your questions:

Four Different Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort: It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Its time complexity is O(n^2) in the average and worst cases and O(n) in the best case.
Merge Sort: It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.
Quick Sort: It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the chosen pivot. Elements smaller than the pivot are placed to its left, and elements greater than the pivot are placed to its right. It then recursively sorts the subarrays. Its time complexity is O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case.
Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted list one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into its correct position among the already sorted elements. Its time complexity is O(n^2) in the average and worst cases and O(n) in the best case.
Big O Notation and Time Complexity Evaluation:
Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size. It provides a way to express how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input.

To evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm:

Identify the basic operations that contribute to the algorithm's runtime.
Determine how many times each basic operation is executed as a function of the input size.
Express the total number of basic operations as a mathematical function of the input size.
Simplify the function using Big O notation, focusing on the dominant term.
Selecting the Best Sorting Algorithm:
The best sorting algorithm depends on various factors such as:

Size of the input: Some algorithms perform better on small datasets (e.g., Insertion Sort), while others are more efficient on large datasets (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
Memory constraints: Some algorithms require additional memory space (e.g., Merge Sort), while others sort the list in place (e.g., Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
Stability requirement: If maintaining the order of equal elements is crucial, stable sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Insertion Sort are preferred.
Stable Sorting Algorithm:
A stable sorting algorithm is one that preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output as they were in the original input. For example, if two elements have the same key, a stable sorting algorithm will ensure that their relative order remains unchanged after sorting. Merge Sort and Insertion Sort are examples of stable sorting algorithms.
